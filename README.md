# Pythonic - Python based Programming language

### Why building own programming language?
1. To understand completely how each and every token works.
2. Understanding basic fundamental blocks of programming language in depth.
3. To understand the architecture, design principles, syntax, semantics, and underlying implementation details.
4. In depth understanding of compilers, interpreters and debuggers.
